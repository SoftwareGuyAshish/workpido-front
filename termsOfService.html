          can either withdraw or use for purchases on Workpido Services in
          accordance with these Terms of Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>WORKPIDOS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is free to create workpidos. A new Seller may create up to ten
          workpidos. After successfully completing one order, a Seller may
          create an unlimited number of workpidos.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each workpido is manually approved by a Support Specialist before
          being posted in the Marketplace. Workpido reserves the right to modify
          or delete workpidos that violate these Terms of Service and/or the
          Related documents. Users can learn more about the approval process for
          workpidos here.
        </li>
        <li>
          By selling a workpido, Sellers agree to render all included services
          for all orders of the workpido. Sellers do not have the right to
          refuse to sell an active workpido to a Buyer who pays for the order
          and provides all necessary information to complete it. Sellers provide
          their services to Buyers independently and bear full responsibility
          for the completion or non-completion of all orders. It is prohibited
          to divide a single order of the same service into several smaller
          orders (i.e. creating duplicate orders) to artificially increase a
          Seller’s total number of orders. In such cases, Workpido reserves the
          right to penalize workpidos and/or the User.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers are prohibited from misleading Buyers regarding the service(s)
          they provide. Violations will result in sanctions and/or the permanent
          suspension of the offending workpido and/or the Seller’s account
        </li>
        <li>
          If a violation is reported, Workpido has the right to remove such
          content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Should it be deemed fit, Workpido reserves the right to unilaterally
          hide work from a User's portfolio.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers must remove any and all mistakes, errors, or inconsistencies
          on a workpido page as soon as they are discovered. A common error is a
          discrepancy between the scope, delivery, price, and other fields of a
          workpido. For instance, suppose a Seller writes in their workpido’s
          description that the scope of their workpido is 1,000 words, but
          enters 2,000 words in the "Scope of this workpido '' field. In that
          case, the true volume will be considered 2,000 words. The information
          indicated in the dedicated field shall prevail and take precedence
          over all else. All disputes arising from such discrepancies shall be
          resolved in favor of the Buyer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>ORDERS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Buyers are required to pay for orders in advance. Payments are held
          safely by Partners until the order is completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before starting an order, the User (Seller) must make sure that it
          complies with Workpido's list of Prohibited Services. If the Buyer is
          requesting a prohibited service, the Seller must cancel the order and
          contact the Support Team.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a Buyer's assignment differs in description and scope from the
          service described by the Seller and the Seller accepted the order,
          priority is given to the Buyer's assignment. Assignments can be given
          over correspondence before an order is placed, as well as when
          ordering a workpido.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Order completion start here -->
      <h4>ORDER COMPLETION</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An order is marked as Complete after it is approved by the Buyer or
          after arbitration is completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a workpido is delivered, the Buyer has three business days (or
          four days if more than one day falls on a weekend) to approve the
          delivery. If during this period the Buyer neither approves or requests
          revisions, the order will be automatically approved and considered
          completed. If the order’s price is more than $150, the approval period
          is five business days (or six if more than one day falls on a
          weekend).
        </li>
        <li>
          A task-based order is marked as complete when the final task is
          delivered and approved by the Buyer. If a task is not approved or no
          revisions are requested, the task will be automatically approved and
          marked as completed after three business days (or four days if more
          than a day falls on a weekend). If the task’s price is more than $150,
          the approval period is five business days (or six if more than one day
          falls on a weekend).
        </li>
        <li>
          In this case, the entire order will be suspended and will only resume
          once the next task is paid for. If the Buyer does not pay for the next
          task within five days, the Seller will not be able to start working on
          it. At the same time, completed tasks cannot be canceled.
        </li>
        <li>
          As per Workpido rules, the seller’s delivery must be of high quality.
          When a delivery contains an excessive amount of objectively verifiable
          mistakes, the order is considered incomplete.
        </li>
        <li>
          As per Workpido rules, if a buyer cannot review a seller’s delivery
          (for example, if the seller fails to provide proof of work or a final
          product), the order is considered incomplete.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>REVISIONS AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Orders that satisfy criteria outlined in the workpido's description
          and the Buyer's requirements are to be considered successfully
          completed. If an order is not fulfilled, clearly does not meet the
          standards explicitly set on the workpido page, or does not meet the
          Buyer’s order requirements, the Buyer may return the delivered work to
          the Seller for revision. In this case Sellers must provide as many
          revisions until the delivery meets the standards agreed upon without
          asking for additional payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional services (including revisions beyond those needed for the
          order to be considered successfully completed) are offered at the
          discretion of the Seller. Sellers can determine the volume of the
          service that they are willing to offer and the price. Sellers may also
          choose not to offer additional services or revisions or offer them for
          free.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>ORDER CANCELATION</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Both Sellers and Buyers have the right to cancel any order by
          providing a valid cancelation reason. Once a cancelation is confirmed
          by the other party, payment is refunded to the Buyer. If a Buyer
          chooses to cancel an order because a Seller misses a deadline, the
          funds will be returned to the Buyer immediately without the need for
          confirmation from the Seller.
        </li>
        <li>
          Orders cannot be canceled on the basis of a Buyer’s subjective
          evaluation of a Seller’s delivery as long as the service was provided
          in accordance with the information provided on the workpido page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Workpido reserves the right to cancel any order that violates these
          Terms of Service at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Workpido reserves the right to cancel orders for any reason. Common
          cancelation reasons are:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Seller does not accept the order within 24 hours or misses the
            deadline and is unresponsive for more than two weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users display aggressive behavior, use order materials (such as
            personal information) against each other, or Buyers threaten Sellers
            with a bad review
          </li>
          <li>
            Users have provided or included materials that violate a third
            party’s intellectual property rights
          </li>
          <li>
            Users withhold the delivery of services, files, or information
            required to complete a workpido with the intent to gain favorable
            reviews, additional services, or extra payment
          </li>
          <li>
            The Seller submits an order for approval without a complete result
            in order to extend the order deadline
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Sellers must deliver a product that reflects the description of their
          workpido and meets all Buyer requirements. Failure to comply with this
          requirement will allow the Buyer to cancel the order, and may damage
          the Seller's status. When the deadline has passed the order is marked
          as Overdue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Workpido reserves the right to cancel any completed orders or tasks in
          task-based orders, if they are in severe violation of Workpido’s Terms
          of Service (e.g. the type of service is prohibited on Workpido, or the
          order may be fraudulent, etc.). In such cases, the sum paid for the
          canceled order or task will be refunded to the Buyer's balance and
          will be deducted from the Seller's balance or, if there are
          insufficient funds on the Seller's balance, from the future Earnings
          of the Seller. Funds for such an order will be removed from the
          Seller's balance regardless of when the order was completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Partial cancelation of an order is not possible. An order may only be
          canceled completely and with a valid cancelation reason. Reasons for
          canceling include but are not limited to:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Seller used materials that violate another party’s intellectual
            property
          </li>
          <li>The Seller’s delivery is defective or not functioning</li>
          <li>
            The Buyer did not acquire the rights to commercial use of the
            delivery and, as reported, used the delivery for commercial purposes
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All intellectual property rights associated with the delivery of an
          order are transferred to the Buyer after the successful completion and
          payment of the order, unless an alternate agreement is reached between
          the Buyer and the Seller. If intellectual property involves elements
          subject to licensing, the Seller is obliged to transfer the license
          or, if applicable, provide the Buyer with a reasonable warning
          regarding the need for the additional acquisition of a relevant
          license.
        </li>
        <li>
          All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to the Buyer
          shall be subject to full payment for the workpido, and the delivery
          may not be used if payment is canceled for any reason. Violation of
          this rule may result in the suspension of a Buyer’s account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless otherwise specified, Sellers are not entitled to receive and
          may not solicit from the Buyer any and all royalties earned from the
          sale of their work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some workpidos require the purchase of a license for commercial use.
          In such cases, if a User (Buyer) purchases a workpido for personal
          use, the Buyer will own all the rights necessary for such use, and
          will not need a license for commercial use. But if the Buyer intends
          to use it for any purposes that are directly or indirectly related to
          any business or in any other way intended for profit, the Buyer will
          need to purchase a license for commercial use in the manner provided
          for by the relevant workpido.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>EXCHANGE OF CONTACT INFORMATION</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Soliciting and providing contact information, including but not
          limited to name, surname, email address, phone number, and social
          media accounts, as well as agreeing to communicate off of Workpido, is
          prohibited. Violations may lead to a reduction in a Seller’s ratings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exceptions are made for orders for which the exchange of contact
          information is clearly necessary. Examples include but are not limited
          to the provision of an email address from AdSense to set up
          advertising campaigns, a link to a social media account that a Seller
          will grow, and a Skype ID for consulting services. Sellers must
          explicitly indicate the need for certain contact information in
          advance in the description of their workpido or when sending a Custom
          workpido offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers agree that any and all private information provided by Buyers
          is confidential and may not be transferred or used for any purpose
          other than completion of the order itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          All interactions between Buyers and Sellers, including, but not
          limited to, placing orders, payment, negotiation of terms, and
          approval of the delivery must take place within Workpido Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>REVIEWS AND SELLER RATINGS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once an order is completed or canceled, Buyers can leave a review
          about their experience working with the Seller and their impression of
          the Seller’s service. Workpido does not remove reviews unless there is
          a clear violation of Workpido’s Terms of Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Buyers may leave a review within 30 days. For some categories, Buyers
          will have 60 days to leave a review.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once a positive review is posted, a Buyer can edit or delete it within
          30 days. For some categories, positive reviews can be edited or
          deleted within 60 days. Negative reviews can only be edited or deleted
          within two days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Positive and negative reviews influence a Seller's rating. Sellers may
          not artificially inflate or increase their ratings in any way. Sellers
          found to be engaging in such activities will be penalized.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refusing to fulfill an order without a valid reason negatively impacts
          a Seller's rating. For more information about cancelation reasons
          click here. A Seller's workpidos may be put on hold due to multiple
          consecutive refusals or ignored orders (the system automatically
          cancels orders that receive no response from Sellers within 24 hours).
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers may solicit Buyers for reviews, but may not explicitly request
          a positive review.
        </li>
        <li>

          that it may receive from users.

      <h2>PAYMENTS AND FINANCES</h2>
      <h4>WORKPIDO MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE</h4>

      </p>
      <p>

        Buyers are entitled to a refund to their Balance:
      </p>

          it
        </li>
        <li>
          instantly if the Seller doesn’t start working on the order within 24

          instantly if the Seller doesn’t complete the order on time and the
          Buyer chooses to cancel it

      <p>
        Refunds cannot be requested after the Buyer confirms the order is

        order within seven days of the payment. To initiate a return to the same

      <h4>PARTNERS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Workpido cooperates with Partners in order to collect payments from
          Buyers, transfer such payments from Buyers to Sellers, and store funds
          on Users’ Balances. All services related to the withdrawal of funds on
          workpido.com are also performed by Partners.
        </li>
        <li>
          For purposes here mentioned, Users undertake to accept the Partners’
          offer, user agreement, and other documents of the Partner.

        <li>
          Sellers authorize the Partners to receive and transfer payments from
          the Buyer’s account to the Seller’s account. All Users authorize the
          Partners to withhold Workpido’s Service Fee on the basis of these
          Terms of Service for the use of Workpido Services and other fees (if
          applicable).
        </li>
        <li>
          Your account on a Partner’s service may only be linked to one Workpido
          account. It is prohibited to link one credit/debit card, WebMoney
          wallet, or Payoneer account to multiple Workpido accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          All funds available for withdrawal will be stored on your behalf on
          the Partner's account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Workpido reserves the right, through any of the Partners, to freeze
          the transfer of funds in the event of any suspicious or fraudulent
          activity detected on Workpido Services or in case of orders’
          cancelation.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is prohibited to submit a dispute about the cancelation of an order
          or payment, or cancel a transaction through your payment service
          provider, your bank or Partner. This may lead to a temporary hold on
          your account and balance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>PAYING FOR ORDERS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By making or receiving payments through Workpido Services, you accept
          and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers and Buyers undertake to use the Partner's payment system for
          all transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is prohibited to make payments off of Workpido Services. If a User
          is asked to use an alternative payment method, they should immediately
          contact Workpido's Support Team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Orders can be paid with debit and credit cards. Buyers can also use
          funds that they may have on their Balance. Additional payment methods
          may be available in certain locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          By ordering a workpido or a custom offer, Buyers agree to pay Sellers
          for their services, along with all associated commissions and fees.
          When making a purchase, Buyers see the total amount to be paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers agree that the transfer of Earnings from the Partner is
          equivalent to the payment made by the Buyer directly to the Seller.
        </li>
        <li>
          Buyers’ payment obligation to Sellers will be fulfilled after the
          Partner receives the payment. The Partner is responsible for
          transferring funds to Sellers. At the same time, if the Partner does
          not transfer any amounts to the Seller, the Seller must contact
          Workpido, and must not communicate with the Buyer or the Partners
          directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Seller agrees that Workpido may specify payment details in
          receipts, notifications and other documents provided to Buyers, if
          Workpido deems it necessary or reasonable.
        </li>
        <li>
          An additional commission may be charged for the transfer of funds in
          accordance with the Partner's terms and conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>WORKPIDO’S SERVICE FEE</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>By using Workpido, Users agree to pay Workpido’s Service Fee.</li>
        <li>
          Workpido’s Service Fee is determined as follows: Workpido’s Service
          Fee is included in the final price of a Seller’s workpido or custom
          workpido offer. Sellers receive a sum equal to the total order value
          minus Workpido’s Service Fee. Workpido’s Service Fee is calculated
          individually for each order in accordance with our Service Fee table.
          Workpido’s Service Fee decreases as a Seller’s total revenue with a
          Buyer increases.

          Workpido. Therefore, discussing Workpido’s Service Fee is prohibited
          and may lead to a reduction in a Seller’s ratings.

          All prices shown on Workpido in non-US$ currencies are pegged to their
          original price in US dollars. Prices shown in other currencies may
          change in accordance with fluctuations in exchange rates, and may also
          include a conversion fee. The minimum price of a workpido is $10

        </li>
        <li>

          based on the exchange rate on the date of cancelation. The amount

          exchange rate fluctuations, while maintaining the same value in US$.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>TAXES</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Users are responsible for paying any direct or indirect taxes,
          including any GST, VAT or income tax, which may be applied to them
          depending on their place of residence, location or otherwise, in
          accordance with provisions of their jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sellers represent and warrant that they comply at all times with their
          obligations under income tax provisions in their jurisdiction. Prices
          shown on Workpido include all taxes and charges that may apply to
          Sellers.
        </li>
        <li>
          The current legislation may require Workpido or the Partners to charge
          Users with indirect taxes (such as Sales Tax, VAT or GST) or to
          withhold taxes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any amount that Workpido or the Partners will be required to collect
          will be in addition to the purchase amount and any other fees payable
          by Buyers, and any amount that Workpido or the Partners will have to
          withhold will be deducted from Sellers’ income, as required by
          applicable laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          Indirect taxes are in addition to the price indicated on Workpido, and
          in any event, any such taxes will always be displayed to Buyers before
          payment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ARBITRATION)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any disputes and disagreements between a Seller and a Buyer are
          resolved through one-on-one negotiations or with the assistance of a
          Support Team Specialist. If negotiations are unsuccessful, the Buyer
          or the Seller has the right to apply for arbitration
        </li>
        <li>
          To apply for arbitration, a User should click the arbitration link
          under Help located on the Order Page, indicate the relevant category,
          and fill out the arbitration form. The arbitration link appears once
          the order is submitted for approval. The application should contain
          the applicant's username, the username of the other party in the
          dispute, the number and identification of the order under dispute, and
          evidence supporting your position in the dispute.
        </li>
        <li>
          The application will be forwarded to a competent Workpido’s Support
          Team Specialist (the arbiter) to evaluate and resolve the dispute. A
          decision will be reached within 3 business days; however, this time
          period may be extended in exceptionally challenging circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arbiters do not evaluate orders’ creative components, including but
          not limited to colors, fonts, and writing style (with the exception of
          deliveries that clearly do not correspond to the standards displayed
          in the Seller’s portfolio).
        </li>
        <li>
          When working on an order, Sellers should never take action that could
          harm Buyers. For example, Sellers should not make edits or upload
          files that would harm the site or the site’s users while working with
          site accesses. If a Buyer is found to have been hurt by a Seller, the
          arbiter will cancel the order, and the Seller's account will be
          penalized and/or suspended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Should an arbiter discover that an order is in severe violation of
          Workpido’s Terms of Service (e.g. the type of service is prohibited on
          Workpido, or the order may be fraudulent, etc.), the arbiter has the
          right to cancel the order and apply sanctions to both parties. If the
          order is fraudulent or in clear violation of the law, the Buyer’s
          payment shall be returned to their credit/debit card, WebMoney wallet,
          or Payoneer account. In other cases, the funds shall be returned to
          the Buyer’s Balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          If Seller and Buyer have come to a mutual agreement regarding partial
          payment for the order, Workpido's arbiter will decide based on the
          wishes of both parties and the Terms of Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Buyer maintains the right to leave a review for an order that ends
          in arbitration, even if the arbiter rules in favor of the Seller. A
          Buyer may not leave a review when they request additional services
          that exceed the original scope of the order from the Seller.
        </li>
      </ul>
